Student Management System

This repository contains a simple student management system implemented in C language. The system provides basic functionalities to handle students' records, such as adding, searching, changing, and removing entries. It utilizes files as a database to store student information, making it suitable for schools or colleges that need to manage records of thousands of students.

- Change Student Record: Provides the ability to modify a student's name and subject.
- Remove Student Record: Allows the user to delete a student's record from the database.

File Structure:
- `main.c`: Contains the main source code for the student management system.
- `students.txt`: A text file acting as the database, storing the student records.

Usage:
1. Compile the source code using a C compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable to start the student management system.
3. Choose the desired option from the menu to perform the corresponding operation.

Note: The system does not support editing or deleting functionalities at this time.
